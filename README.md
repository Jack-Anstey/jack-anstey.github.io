# Project iMuse

Welcome to project iMuse, a interactive visualization built using React, Bootstrap, SCSS, and of course D3.

Using the Spotify API and Genius API in [this scraper](https://github.com/Jack-Anstey/Spotify-Scraper), we gathered tons of data about the most popular songs in recorded music history (as defined by the Billboard Hot 100) from 1958 to 2021.

With this data (and a ton of pre-processing), we made interactive visualizations for you to enjoy. Visit [jack-anstey.github.io](https://jack-anstey.github.io/) to try it out!
